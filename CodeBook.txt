This is a code book for tidy_dataset. The tidy_dataset is based on the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, available at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip (the .zip file contains original code book for the source dataset).

For information not provided in the current code bok, please refer to the code bok for original dataset.

The dataset contains 11880 observations of 6 variables. The variables are the following:

    subject: an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment
    activity: type of activity performed ("LAYING", "SITTING", "STANDING", "WALKING", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS")
    variable: a measurement (for details, please refer to the original dataset)
    axis: on which axis the measurement was performed ("X", "Y", "Z" or "NA")
    statistic: a summary statistic that has been used ("mean" or "std")
